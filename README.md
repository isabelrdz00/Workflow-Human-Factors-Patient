# Digital Health Workflow and Human Factors Portfolio

## Overview
This repository contains an analysis of healthcare workflow and human factors, showcasing my ability to evaluate and improve patient care processes in complex healthcare environments. This work was completed as part of the **Workflow Human Factors in Digital Health** course at Algonquin College and provides insight into my skills in identifying systemic issues and developing actionable solutions to improve healthcare safety and efficiency.

## Case Study: Herbert Strasser Incident Analysis

### Description
This case study focuses on the tragic case of Herbert Strasser, whose journey through the healthcare system was plagued by systemic failures, including communication lapses, inadequate information transfer, and care fragmentation. These issues contributed to his deteriorating health, ultimately leading to his untimely death. The study identifies critical human factors affecting patient outcomes and proposes a Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and Lean methodology to understand and address these issues.

### Key Topics and Skills
- **Human Factors Analysis**: Detailed examination of communication breakdowns, inadequate care coordination, and other human factors contributing to the incident.
- **Workflow Analysis and Process Improvement**: Application of RCA and Lean methodologies to categorize and address gaps in the healthcare system, from people and processes to tools and technology.
- **Patient Safety and Quality Improvement**: Development of recommendations for secure communication, effective handoff protocols, interoperable EHR systems, and medication management.
- **Recommendations**: Proposes immediate and long-term interventions, including better training for healthcare providers, secure communication methods, and process standardization.
